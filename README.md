# POC - Using `postcard-rpc` for sending measurements to a host
Build upon examples from the `postcard-rpc` workbook, this POC demonstrates how to send measurements to a host using the `postcard-rpc` library.

Currently, it uses a request/response pattern, but the goal is to switch to a publish/subscribe pattern.
